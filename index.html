    <h2>Fun Fact Blog Day!</h2>
    <p>When I pursued my Associates Degree at SUNY Orange, in Upstate New York, in 2017 I was the Student Government President at SUNY Orange dedicated to being a big voice for all, student-leader, and committed to serving my college community as whole for a full academic year. With this humbling privilege, hard work, the trust fellow students had in me, and my dedication full-time to helping hundreds of college students it did not go unnoticed. To my surprise, I got chosen honorably to give a speech and worked with the Governor of New York, Kathy Hochul. In the event of meeting and working with her it was in efforts to support the Excelscior Scholarship for low-income students to be able to pursue their education endeavours and dreams. I was happy to be able to  provide a speech prior to the New York Governor's and to be a fellow leader alongside her to help make a positive difference in passing the Excelsior Scholarship and helping it come true. You can check out my interview with Spectrum News <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/queens/news/2017/03/27/hochul-pushes-free-in-state-tuition-for-ny-budget--but-not-all-are-in-favor">here!</a>

    <h2>Increasing the Efforts of Diversity in Tech Workforces</h2>
    <p>I am a minority-black woman who pursued a college education and obtained a Bachelor of Science in Business Management with a minor in Political Science from the State University of New York in New Paltz in 2021. Throughout my college journey prior, I actively engaged in extracurricular activities, serving as Chief Justice for three consecutive academic years in the judicial board of the Student Association at SUNY New Paltz. In this role, I tirelessly advocated for equality, diversity, and inclusion, working alongside fellow team members to address challenges faced by students in the college community. As Chief Justice, my primary focus was to promote fairness and equality, ensuring a supportive environment for all students. I remained dedicated to my duty, maintaining impartiality, upholding confidentiality, and providing a just and fair resolution to student issues, complaints, and appeals. This involved consistent communication with students, faculty, staff, and higher-ups, fostering an environment where all students could thrive academically. Driven by my passion for personal growth and making a difference, I am now eager to leverage my experiences and skills in the dynamic tech field of Software Engineering. I am committed to expanding my technical knowledge and pursuing a career where I can contribute to innovative solutions and create positive societal impact. As a minority-black woman, I am inspired to drive diversity and inclusivity in the industry. I firmly believe that embracing diverse perspectives leads to innovation and positive change. With unwavering determination and a thirst for knowledge, I am excited to embark on this new chapter, contributing to organizations that share my values and commitment to inclusivity. Together, I strongly believe we can shape a future where every individual has equal opportunities to thrive and succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.
<div>
  Some ways I would increase efforts towards diversity and inclusion in the tech industry, if a company was lacking, is to actively contribute as a minority leader who believes in and encourages positive growth in the workforce. I have found my passion in the tech field, where I can wholeheartedly envision myself thriving. Engaging and networking with like-minded individuals who understand the significance of diversity and inclusion is another avenue I would eagerly explore. My passion for leadership has been ingrained in me from a young age, despite facing financial hardships during my childhood. This passion has been exemplified throughout my college experience, driving me to actively pursue a career in tech as a minority-black woman. It is disheartening to see that only 1.7% of black women and 7.4% of black professionals are represented in the tech workforce, as reported by CNBC. I aspire to be a catalyst for change, contributing to a diverse organizational culture where individuals from various backgrounds can participate in the beautiful tech oasis of digital innovation. When I contemplate the significance of digital innovation and the opportunity to embark on an internship that fosters a rich learning experience in becoming a participant in this realm, it fills me with immense fulfillment. This is why I am driven to pursue a career as a Software Engineer. I firmly believe that by embracing diversity and inclusion, we can unlock endless possibilities for innovation and create a tech industry that truly represents and serves all.</div></p>

    <h2>The American Dream in Aspiration</h2>
    <p>I am an American citizen, born and raised in the small village of New Paltz, Upstate New York. New Paltz holds a special place in my heart as it is my hometown. Both of my parents were born in Jamaica, with my father immigrating to the United States at the age of 23 and my mother arriving when she was only 11 years old. They, like many immigrants, came to America with dreams of a better life. My grandparents also made the journey to the U.S., seeking improved financial opportunities and a brighter future for their children. They believed that in America, their children could become anything they aspired to be. However, despite their dreams, my family faced numerous financial hardships throughout our lives in the United States. There were instances when I experienced homelessness during my childhood. Despite growing up in a low-income household, the spirit of the American Dream remained strong within my family. I harbor no regrets about my upbringing as it has shaped me into the resilient woman I am today. I am a firm believer, a go-getter, and someone who never gives up or backs down, regardless of the challenges I face. My experiences have taught me to remain strong and stay motivated in order to overcome any circumstances. I refuse to let circumstances define me; instead, they serve as fuel to drive me forward. Adaptability is not only a powerful skill but also one of my greatest gifts, enabling me to achieve academic success and aspire towards positive changes in my career as a prospective Software Engineer. This is the path I dream of pursuing in Americaâ€”a journey of growth, resilience, and the fulfillment of my aspirations.</p>
